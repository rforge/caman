Description: Tools for the analysis of finite semiparametric mixtures.
        These are useful when data is heterogeneous, e.g. in
        pharmacokinetics or meta-analysis. The NPMLE and VEM algorithms
        (flexible support size) and EM algorithms (fixed support size)
        are provided for univariate and bivariate data
