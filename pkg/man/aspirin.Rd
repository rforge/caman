\title{Meta-analysis and metaregression of aspirin use and breast cancer risk}
\description{
To examine the recent epidemiological studies on aspirin use and breast cancer risk published from 2001 to 2007 within a meta-analysis, to investigate reasons for heterogeneity between the individual studies. \cr

We systematically searched for cohort-studies and case-control-studies from 2001-2007, which evaluated the association between aspirin and breast cancer risk. A total of 15 studies (seven cohort studies and eight case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria.
