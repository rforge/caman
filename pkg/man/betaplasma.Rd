\title{Determinants of Beta-Carotene Levels}
\description{
Observational studies have suggested that low dietary intake or low plasma 
concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, or other carotenoids might be associated 
with increased risk of developing certain types of cancer.  However, relatively few 
studies have investigated the determinants of plasma concentrations of these 
micronutrients. Nierenberg et al. designed a cross-sectional study to investigate the relationship between personal characteristics and dietary factors, and plasma concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene and other carotenoids. Study subjects (N = 315) were patients 
who had an elective surgical procedure during a three-year period to biopsy or 
remove a lesion of the lung, colon, breast, skin, ovary or uterus that was found to be non-cancerous.
