\title{
Compute false discovery rates and related statistics
}
\description{
This function is especially useful in the context of genetic data.

\usage{
getFDR(dat, threshold = 0.7, idxNotDiff = 1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dat}{
A mixtures, i.e. a \code{CAMAN.object}.
}
  \item{threshold}{
numeric, should be between 0 and 1 to be meaningful.
}
  \item{idxNotDiff}{
integer, index of component for which computations are required.
}
}
\details{
See Schlattmann (2009) for more details.
