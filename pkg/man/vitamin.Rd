of cancer as discussed in Sect. 2.1. Fawzi et al. (1993) study the effect of vitamin
A supplementation and childhood mortality in preschool children. They concluded

when given periodically to children at the community level.  All studies were
community randomized trials from South Asia or Southeast Asia, except the second
study, which was from northern Sudan. This data set contains the log relative risk and corresponding variance. The data is supplied in three different formats
